# Task 2 – Speech Recognition using Wav2Vec2 

## Project Overview
This project is part of my AI internship.

The goal of this task is to build a **Speech Recognition system** that converts spoken audio into text using a **pretrained deep learning model**.

In this project, I have used **Wav2Vec2**, a state-of-the-art speech-to-text model developed by Facebook AI, which is widely used in real-world applications such as voice assistants, transcription tools, and accessibility software.

## Objective 

The objective of this task is to:
- Take a speech audio file as input
- Process the audio using a pretrained AI model
- Convert spoken words into readable text
- Display the transcribed text in the terminal

This task demonstrates the practical use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** in speech-based applications.

## Model Used
- **Model Name:** facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h
- **Model Type:** Pretrained Speech Recognition Model
- **Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers
- **Backend:** PyTorch

The model is pretrained on large English speech datasets and can directly perform inference without additional training.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Libraries Used:**
  - torch
  - transformers
  - librosa
  - soundfile

## Project Files

- "speech_to_text.py"
  Contains the Python code for loading the model, reading audio, and generating transcription.

- "audio.wav"
  Sample WAV audio file containing speech input.
